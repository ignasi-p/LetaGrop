N Y T I T   (ETITR = emf titration  data) LETAGROP

  PC version of LETAGROP-ETITR or LETAGROP-NYTIT (Havel)
              (September 92)
   From  potentiometric data (added volume, E) with electrode
sensitive to A (for instance H+) or B (e.g. a metal ion or e-), or
with both sorts of electrodes, "best" values are calculated for the
formation constants of complexes of A, B, C, and L. Eo values, factors
for liquid junction emfs, corrections to analytical values, and the
concentration of a weak acid HX (often as impurity) may also be adjusted.

Background.
 Two, three or four components, A, B, (C, L) form a series
of complexes, with formation constants ki. The notation, equilibrium
and mass balance equations are given under "BDTV".

Titration.
 The experiment starts with Vo ml of a solution with the
total concentrations Ao,Bo,Co,Lo. At some experimental point we have
added VT ml of a solution with the total concentrations AT,BT,CT, and
LT. The total volume of the solution is then
 Vtot= Vo +fV x VT
 The total concentrations are
       A (= Atot)    = (Ao x Vo + AT x VT)/ Vtot
       B (= Btot)    = (B0 x Vo + BT x VT)/ Vtot,       etc.
       C
       L
       etc.
       
 The factor fV ("vfak" in the program ) is set =1 in an ordinary
buret titration. In a coulometric titration one sets fV=0, VT = the
number of micro-faradys added, and, say, AT = +0.001 if protons are
added, -0.001 if they are removed during the electrolysis.
(Correspondingly if e.g. Ag+, Cd 2+ or e- are added or removed).
With equal additions VT from two burets one may set fV=2 and for AT,
BT, and CT use the sums of the concentrations in the two burets.

If the buret solution is changed at some time during the titration,
the new AT, BT (CT, LT) and fV are given as a "false experimental
points" with a negative VT (see "input" below).
A, B, C and the dilution factor
         fdil ("dil") = Vo/Vtot                                 (3)
are calculated in PUTS by a procedure Titer, and the results are
picked up in UBBE by a procedure Titut.

 Certain  analytival corrections can then be introduced, to minimize
the error square sum; they are listed as ks below. For A one may
assume either a correction ks3 = dAo to Ao, or a correction ks4 = dAT
to AT or a correction ks5 = dA to both Ao and AT ( but preferably
not more than one of these). One may also adjust the analytical
value for B by multiplication  with a factor 1+ks8 = fB  (Bfak in
the program). The first guess is of course dAo = dAT = dA = 0, fB=1.
Moreover one may assume the presence of a weak acid HX, with the
acidity constant KHX, either in the original solution only (Ks6 =cHX)
or in all solutions (Ks7 = cHXall).
(One may easily change the program to allow also for a dibasic dirt
acid H2X, setting dirt = 2, see procedure DIRTY.)

EMF values.
 For each poit we measure one or two emf values, one
dependent on a (ususally = h)
        E = Eo  + fE   x ln a  + Ej                    (4)
the other dependent on b
	EB= EoB + fEB  x ln b  + Ej                    (5)
	Here,
	           -1
	    fE = RTF  ,  fEB  = fE/ne                  (6)
	    (Efak, EBfak in the program)
are calculated from the temperature, ag1 = t (o C), and the number ag2
= ne, and we have                    -1   
        Ej = jac x h + jalk x Kw x h                   (7)
	
	    
The program may use procedures Hure and Bure to calculate ln a (ln h) and
ln b from E and EB.
 The program can also be used for redox titrations in which case the
electron  e-  is counted as one component, usually B since A must be
reserved for H+. It may often be convenient to use a positive or negative
number of electrones, as the formal component B: "e- +", e-e- 2+" or ee 2-".
One must remember two things: 1) the total concentration of B must never
become negative, 2) the equations are solved somewhat more rapidly if all
species contain either one B or none. E.g., one may have
 (Fe 2+ = C, "e-+" = B, Fe 3+ = BC) or (Fe 3+ = C, e- = B, Fe 2+ = BC); 
 (H+ = A, UO2 2+ = C, ee 2- = B, U 4+ = A4BC ) or (H+ = A, U 4+ = C, e-e-
 2+ = B, UO2 2+ = A-4 BC) or even  (H+ = A, e- = B, UO2 2+ = C, U 4+ A4B2C)
In the equation for EB (5, 6) ne is simply the charge of the B chosen: -1
for e-, +2 for e2 2+, etc. 
 The activity scale for B must be defined so that the formal activity b
never causes any trouble in the mass balance equations.  E.g., one may
keep the formation constant of Fe 3+ ( Fe 2+ + e-+ = Fe 3+) constant at
10 exp(10), to keep the formal [e-+] low. The value for Eo (e-+) will
                                                                     o
then come out as eo (Fe 2+, Fe 2+/Pt) + 10 x 59.156 - e ref, taking e  and
e ref on the hydrogen scale.

Calculations, use of Typ and val.

  The equilibrium calculations are made be means of BDTV. 
     Typ = 1 if only EA is known,
     Typ = 2 if only EB is known,
 and Typ = 3 if both EA and EB are known.
  PUTS finds out the number of components, Nkom, by using Nas = 2 + 2
x Nkom.
The following table gives a survey of the present uses of Typ and Val.

Typ    Val   known       BA    fel           not used
             besides C L
	     
1      1-3   aB          2     delta A
       4     H=A B       3     delta ln a
2      1     A b         1     delta B 
       2     A B         3     delta ln b 
3      1     a b         0     delta A         (B)
       2                       delta B         (A)
       3     H=A b       1     delta ln a      (B)
       4                       delta B         (A)
       5     a B         2     delta ln b      (A)
       6     A B         3     delta ln b      (a)
      
      The third column names the quantities that are assumed to be
known exactly in the calculation and the fifth gives the error fel
[val] to be used in the calculation of the error square sum U. For
Typ =1, fel[2] and fel[3] are equal to fel[1] divided by B or C. When
the "fel" is given as delta ln a or delta ln b, the proportional
quantities  delta E or delta EB  are really used.
With two emfs, for each val some part of the experimental information
is not being used as indicated by the last column.

Use of arrays for various Typ values
ag  = temp, Ne (if EB is given)
as  = Ao Bo AT BT Vo fV,              if Nkom =2
      Ao Bo Co AT BT CT Vo fV,        if Nkom =3
      Ao Bo Co Lo AT BT CT LT Vo fV,  if Nkom =4 
      
ap = 1) VT E +A +B (+C +L ) +fdil +ln a +ln b (+ln c + ln l), if Typ = 1
     2) VT EB +A +B (+C +L) +fdil +lna +ln b (+ln c +ln l),   if Typ = 2
     3) VT E  EB +A +B (+C +L) +fdil +lna +ln b (+ln c +ln l),if Typ = 3
k= k1 = jac, k2 = jalk, k3 = KHX, k4 = Kw, kik > 4 = á                  
ak = pot, p , q,  (r, t,)
ks = Eo, EBo, dAo, dAT, dA, cHX, c HXall, 1-fB
As usual, a "+" means that the value is not given in the input but is
calculated by the program.

Input

The input is easy  to deduce from the general rules, knowing what the as, ap,
etc are. We give first the general expressions and then a specific
example with three components, A = H+, measuring ( and trusting) EA and
                                         2
EB, and minimizing U = ä (A calc - A exp) , hence Typ = 3, val = 1.

 A change of buret solution in the course of a titration (inside a grpoup)
is indicated by inserting, at the right place among the ap, (-1, A'T, B'T,
(C'T, L'T) f' V). If necessary, one or two zeros are added to make the
number of data correspond to n =2 or 3 "false experimental points". This
n is included in the Np first given and is later subtracted in the
program.
