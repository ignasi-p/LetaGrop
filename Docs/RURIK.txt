                          LETAGROP MANUAL
              
   This general manual describes information which should follow
after each RURIK number. Please, observe that here the Rurik's
are given not in the order they should be given in the input
data file but in the order corresponding to their value.  


Rurik = 1

   U is calculated for the selected data sets (Rs1 through Rs2 given
in Rurik 11) using available data and parameters. Rs are the
individual groups (sets) of data (e.g., the individual separated
titrations).  U = sum of squares of residuals (Y(exp)-Y(calcd)),
see also Rurik 18.


Rurik = 2

   U is calculated and for each point the quantities of interest
(input data, errors, etc) are printed (Uttag = OUTPUT)
U = sum of squares of residuals (Y(exp)-Y(calc)), see also Rurik 18.


Rurik = 3, N, (ivar[i], w)
                          N
   Preparation for a shot, while varying only common parameters k.
The N parameters k[ik] with the numbers ik = ivar[i], i = 1 ->N
are to be varied.
If w is positive, it gives the initial step,  stek[i] := w,
if w is negative,  stek[i] := stekfak x abs(dark[ik]), see
also Rurik 4.


Rurik = 4, W (stekfak/tolU)

   If a value for the standard deviation (in twisted space) dark[ik]
or darks[Rs,ik] of the parameters has been calculated, and W is
positive, then the step stek[i] in the next variation
(shot) is the product of dark or darks with stekfak (=W).
Stekfak is automatically set to 0.5 at the beginning of the
calculations, but if the pit deviates strongly from a pure 2nd
degree function, it may be advisable to set a lower value such
as 0.2 or 0.1. The input is then e.g. "4,0.1". The new stekfak
then remains until changed.
  If the quantity (W) is negative, then its absolute value
is used as tolU (default =1.E-6)


Rurik = 5

   A shot is made, with the instructions given
after Rurik =3, 19, or 20.


Rurik = 6 , Ns, Nag, Nas, Nap, (ag)  , (Np, (as) ,((ap)   )  )
                                   Nag         Nas     Nap Np  Ns
   The data are given: Nag common quantities ag; for each of the
Ns groups (sets of data = satser) Nas quantities as are given;
and for each of the Np[Rs] points of a certain group, the Nap
quantities ap (Y, X1, X2 ...). (procedure DATA)


Rurik = 7, (common), (group), (twist),

   Information on adjustable parameters (procedure LASK).
Alternatives for the three parts:

(common) = a) Nk,Nk,Nak,(k,(ak)  )         ; new problem
                              Nak Nk
           b) Nk, Nbyk,(ik,k,(ak)   )      ; partial change
                                 Nak Nbyk
           c) Nk,0;   no change

(group)  = a) Nks, Nks,((ks)   )        ; new problem,
                            Nks Ns      ;  same if Nks =1 or 0.
                                        ; If Nks =0, only 0,0 is given
           b) Nks,1,j,(ks)                   ; [Rs,j] is exchanged
                          Ns                 ;  in all sets.
           c) Nks,-1,m,(j)                   ; ks[Rs} are set :=0
                          m                  ;  for the j values given
           d) Nks,0,m,(j) , ((ks[Rs,j]) )    ; all ks =0 except m of
                         m             m Ns  ;  them in each group
           e) Nks,0,0; no change

(twist) =  a) skin,(ik,jk,sk)         ; values given for some twist
                             skin     ;   matrix terms
           b) 0; no change


Rurik =7, Nk,-1,Negk,(ik)
                         Negk             
   The "posk" protection is removed from Negk of the k parameters,
which are thus allowed to be negative. Must be given again after
a change of the adjustable parameters through Rurik =7.


Rurik = 8, Nok, stegbyt, (start,tol)
                                    Nok                   
   The mass-balance equations for each point in UBBE contain
Nok unknown quantities to be determined, and start[i] and tol[i]
are the starting values, and tolerances to be used in solving
them.  The order of the components B,(C,L,)A if procedure BDTV
is used. (See also BDTV and the input for special programs).
"Stegbyt" is the value for the step in Kalle (or Kille) where
one switches from binary approach to "chord shooting".  Since
the steps take the values 2exp(-n), any value between 0.50 and
0.25 (such as 0.45, 0.4 or 0.3) gives the same effect.
For equations of high degree 'n', a stegbyt value around 1/n
seems appropriate, but the run time does not seem very sensitive
to the choice of stegbyt.


Rurik=9, Typ 

   The number Typ tells the type of problem and picks out the right
labels in the switches in procedures PUTS and UBBE.
Use before Rurik=6.


Rurik=10, vmax.

   Gives the number of loops in procedure Kalle after which x and y
values are printed, as an indication of bad values for tol and
start after Rurik=8.


Rurik =11, Rs1,Rs2 
  
   Gives the numbers of the first and last in the series of data
groups to be treated. See also Rurik 21.


Rurik=12, Skrikut 
  
   Skrikut is a number which may be used to suppress certain types
of output. At present the values 1,0,-1,and -2 are used. The output
stated below is printed for the first Skriut values but suppressed
for those in parentheses.

 - Variation of k (not Tage)
     - kv and U during shot, Minskasteg, Stegupp, Komner,
       s[ik,jk] values:  1 0 (-1  -2) if not Koks,
                         1 0  -1 (-2) if Koks 
     - Minusgrop, kbom, darr, sigy, U at PROVA, Gamla konstanter,
       slumpskott, Umin+kmin in slumpskott, MIKO,
       partial results: all
 - Variation of Ks; Tage and Koks
     - kv and U during shot:  1 (0 -1 -2)
     - Minska steg, Stegupp, kbom, darr, sigy, s[ik,jk] values,
       U at PROVA, MIKO, Gamla konstanter,
       partial results: 1 0 (-1 -2)
     - Slumpskott, Umin+kmin in Slumpskott:  1 0 -1 (-2)
     - Minusgrop: all


Rurik = 13

   Print available  "best" values for k and ks, with their
darr (standard deviation as calculated)  (procedure SKRIK)


Rurik = 14 /text on the next line/

   Text on following line is printed. Can of course be
repeated: 14 /text/ 14 /text/...


Rurik=15

   The information on the k[ik] and their standard deviations is
transformed to decadic logarithms (procedure Logkik).  The limits
given correspond approximately to log (k+-3s(k));  if s(k) > 0.2 x k,
only the "best" value for log k, and the maximum value,
log (k+3s(k)) is given.


Rurik = 16:  new page in the output. :-)


Rurik = 17,
 1(Styr), sigfak, Nskytt, Nvar, (ik)    , Nin (k,(ak)    ,dark)
                                    Nvar             Nak      Nin
   This starts one cycle of the species selector. Sigfak is the
rejection factor F(sigma) so that a protected parameter is
rejected if, after Nskytt "shots", it comes out as k<F(sigma) x
sigma(k). Out of the initial Nk k values, Nvar are to be varied,
and their numbers are given. Nin new parameters will be added in
time and tried: their ak values, and first guesses for suitable
k and stek values are given. Warning: Nk+Nin must not exceed
the number of k's allowed in the program.


Rurik=17, 5(Styr), sigfak, Nskytt

   Starts another cycle of the species selector, giving previously
rejected parameters (species) one more chance.


Rurik=18, val

  Val tells which deviation fel[val] is to be used in
calculating U. Val is automatically set =1 after Rurik =9 (new Type).


Rurik = 19, N, (ik,w) , Nskott, Nvaks, (ik,w)
                     N                       Nvaks
     Preparation for shot with Koks true. N of the common
parameters are to be varied (information as for Rurik=3) on an
"upper level". For each set of the common k on the upper level,
a certain number of ks parameters are to be adjusted in order to
give for each group the lowest possible U value.  With Rurik=19,
a certain set of Nvaks group parameters ks are to be varied,
the same ones in each group. The numbers are given, together
with w (the stek if positive, else stekfak x abs(darks[Rs,ik])
is used for stek). For each set of k parameters during a shot
on the upper level, Nskott shots are to be made varying
the ks in each group. See also Rurik=20.


Rurik = 20, N, (ik,w) , Nskott, Nvaks, (Rs,ik,w)
                     N                          Nvaks
   Like for Rurik = 19 except that the ks[Rs,ik] parameters to
be adjusted are handpicked: so, Nvaks is the total number of ks
to be adjusted.
   After the preparation by Rurik =3,19,or 20, the shot is
ordered by Rurik =5, three shotts by "5,5,5" etc. (Rurik =4
need not be stated every time).
    For varying only ks parameters and no common k (earlier
Rurik =10) one may use Rurik =19 with N=0.


Rurik =21, RsN, (Rsi)
                     RsN
   RsN sets of data are selected to be treated. The sets of data
groups (Rsi) may be in any order. See also Rurik 11.


Order of input Rurik

   Begin with descriptive text and data: 14, 9,6,
Uttag(OUTPUT) (2) must be preceded by 7,8 (if equations are
to be solved), 11 or 21 (if not all groups will be treated). Note
that if 2 is given, N is set =0 so that 3, or 19, or 20 must
again be given if a new 5 is wanted.
   A shot (5) or a cycle of the species selector (17) must be
preceded by 7,8,11, and 3 (or 19, or 20), and by 18 (if val is not 1).
   Try to get familiar with the proper use of the other Rurik
numbers such as 4,10,12,13,15,16.
   The run is finished by -1, or any other Rurik<1 or >21. This can
happen by accident if there are misprints in the input data.
